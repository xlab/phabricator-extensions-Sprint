Manage your tasks with Points in Phabricator

Sprint provides a statistical overview of task activity, using the workboard as its primary source.
It includes a burndown chart that is always current with activity on the workboard.
It also adds pie chart visualization of the relationships between points, tasks, task status and workboard columns.

To enable a project as a Sprint, simply select the "Is Sprint" checkbox in the Project Edit Details page.
After a project is enabled as a Sprint, you must then enter a start and end date to define the period scope.
Then add some tasks to that project, and edit them to set some story points. 

You can also view a list of all Sprint enabled projects by going to the Sprint application main interface at 
/project/sprint.

Only tasks in Sprints have "Story Points".
